# 🔒 Secure Kubernetes Deployment

This project automates the deployment of a **production-grade Kubernetes cluster** with a strong focus on **GitOps workflows**, **infrastructure security**, and **cloud-native best practices**.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Provision a secure Kubernetes environment using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automate continuous delivery with GitOps principles.

**Key Features:**
- Cluster provisioning with Terraform (EKS/AKS/Kind)
- GitOps deployment via ArgoCD or FluxCD
- Kubernetes hardening (RBAC, PodSecurityStandards, Network Policies)
- Automated secrets management with Vault
- Monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana
- End-to-end encryption and security best practices

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Infrastructure:** Terraform, AWS EKS / Azure AKS
- **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes
- **GitOps:** ArgoCD / FluxCD
- **Security:** Vault, OPA/Gatekeeper, Trivy, PodSecurityStandards
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## 🛡️ Security Hardening Steps

- Enforced namespace-level and pod-level RBAC policies
- Applied Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to restrict traffic
- Enabled Kubernetes audit logs
- Integrated vulnerability scanning for container images
- Secured secrets with dynamic injection from Vault

---

## 📈 Lessons Learned

- Deepened understanding of secure multi-cloud Kubernetes deployments
- Gained hands-on experience with GitOps and CI/CD security gates
- Tuned monitoring and alerting for proactive cluster health management

---

## ✍️ Future Improvements

- Add Kyverno for dynamic Kubernetes policy validation
- Expand monitoring to include Loki and distributed tracing (Jaeger)
- Integrate Zero Trust architecture with service mesh (Istio / Linkerd)
