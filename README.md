# 🛠️ 1. GitOps + Secure Kubernetes Deployment

**Summary:**  
Deploy a production-grade Kubernetes cluster using GitOps workflows and security best practices.

**Key Skills Shown:**
- Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Kubernetes (Pods, Services, Ingress Controllers)
- GitOps with ArgoCD or FluxCD
- Kubernetes security (RBAC, PodSecurityStandards, TLS encryption)
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)

**Stack:**  
Terraform, Kubernetes (AKS, EKS, Kind), ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana, Vault

**Why:**  
Demonstrates cloud infrastructure automation, GitOps, and cluster security expertise.

# 🚀 2. CI/CD Pipeline with Security Gates

**Summary:**  
Build a full CI/CD pipeline that includes automatic security scanning (SAST, DAST, secret detection) on every commit.

**Key Skills Shown:**
- CI/CD pipeline design (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI)
- Docker build, scan, and deploy
- Static code analysis (SAST) with CodeQL
- Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Secrets detection with GitLeaks

**Stack:**  
GitHub Actions, Docker, Terraform (optional), Trivy, GitLeaks, CodeQL

**Why:**  
Proves you can embed security early (Shift Left) in DevOps pipelines, a top priority for modern enterprises.

# ☁️ 3. Infrastructure as Code: Multi-tier Web App Deployment

**Summary:**  
Use Terraform to provision a scalable multi-tier application infrastructure in AWS or Azure.

**Key Skills Shown:**
- Terraform IaC for VPC, networking, EC2 instances, RDS/SQL
- Cloud networking (public/private subnets, security groups)
- Auto-scaling and load balancing setup
- Basic Monitoring setup (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor)

**Stack:**  
Terraform, AWS (EC2, RDS, ALB) or Azure (VMSS, SQL Database, App Gateway)

**Why:**  
Demonstrates full cloud-native infrastructure automation — a core DevOps engineering skill.
