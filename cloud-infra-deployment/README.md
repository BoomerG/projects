# ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure Deployment

This project demonstrates how to **provision a scalable, production-ready multi-tier application infrastructure** in the cloud using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** best practices.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Automate the deployment of a complete cloud environment capable of hosting a web application with **high availability**, **security**, and **cost optimization** in mind.

**Key Features:**
- Automated creation of VPC, subnets, route tables, and gateways
- Highly available web server clusters
- Secure private database subnet
- Load balancer for public access and scalability
- IAM roles and security groups following least privilege principles

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform
- **Cloud Providers:** AWS (preferred) or Azure
- **Networking:** VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, Route Tables
- **Compute:** EC2 Instances (AWS) or VMSS (Azure)
- **Database:** RDS (AWS) or Azure SQL
- **Load Balancer:** ALB (AWS) or Azure App Gateway
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch (AWS) or Azure Monitor

## 🏗️ Key Infrastructure Components

- **VPC:** Custom CIDR blocks, multiple subnets (public/private)
- **Web Layer:** Auto-scaling EC2 instances in private subnets
- **Database Layer:** Encrypted RDS database with subnet groups and security groups
- **Ingress:** Application Load Balancer with HTTPS termination
- **IAM:** Role-based access control for EC2 instances and Lambda functions (if applicable)
- **Monitoring:** Basic CPU, memory, and networking metrics via CloudWatch or Azure Monitor

## 📈 Lessons Learned

- Modularized Terraform code for scalability and reusability
- Implemented secure, high-availability cloud architecture
- Applied best practices for multi-environment deployment (dev/staging/prod)

---

## ✍️ Future Improvements

- Add S3 backend state management with remote locking
- Integrate cost optimization strategies like instance right-sizing
- Implement serverless architecture options for certain workloads
- Extend to multi-region deployments with DNS failover
