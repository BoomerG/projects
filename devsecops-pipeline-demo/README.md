# 🚀 DevSecOps Pipeline Demo

This project demonstrates a full **DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline** integrating **security at every stage** of the development lifecycle — from code commit to production deployment.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Build and showcase a secure CI/CD pipeline that automates code testing, container building, security scanning, and deployment.

**Key Features:**
- Automated code build, test, scan, and deploy
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Secrets detection and compliance checks
- Secure promotion to production environment

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI)
- **SAST:** CodeQL
- **Secrets Detection:** GitLeaks
- **Container Scanning:** Trivy
- **DAST:** OWASP ZAP Baseline Scan
- **Infrastructure as Code (optional):** Terraform, Kubernetes

## 🛡️ Security Gates in Pipeline

- **CodeQL Analysis:** Detect vulnerabilities in source code at build time
- **GitLeaks:** Prevent secrets and sensitive information from leaking into repos
- **Trivy Scan:** Check Docker images for known vulnerabilities before pushing
- **OWASP ZAP:** Perform lightweight DAST against deployed application endpoints
- **Terraform Lint & Security Scan:** Validate IaC against best practices (optional)

---

## 📈 Lessons Learned

- Integrated security early (Shift Left Security) in the SDLC
- Balanced automation speed with actionable security results
- Developed modular pipelines that adapt to multiple environments (Dev, QA, Prod)

---

## ✍️ Future Improvements

- Add Infrastructure-as-Code scanning (tfsec, Checkov)
- Implement automated container signing (Cosign)
- Introduce RBAC-driven GitOps deployments post-scan
